In the modern world the problem of applying advisory systems for the simplification of our lifes gains specifical significanse. In our thesis work we focuse our attention mainly on application of advisory systems in financial markets.
Great attention in our thesis work is paid to explanation of the operation principles of the SVD algorithm. Simply put, Singular Value Decomposition is the multiplication of 3 matrixes. The algorithm is based on one property of SVD. We can truncate the middle matrix but the result of truncated multiplication will tend to the original multiplication. This fact is used to speed up the prediction of recommendations.
In addition, we consider 3 basic models of advisory systems: normal, user-based and item-based. We hope to establish their advantages and disadvantages in the near future.
An important part of the thesis work is the choise of the quality assessment metric. The most commonly used metric is RMSE, but there are others metrics. Just like the models, they have their own advantages and disadvantages.
Finally, we need to evaluate the application of our constructed system in the financial sector. There are different markets, so our system should be adaptive to all of them.
