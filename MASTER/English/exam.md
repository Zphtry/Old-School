So the auther lets us to get more info about CWT.

### Intro
The 
### Fourier Transform
### Wawelet transform
### Complex Morlet Wavelet
### Scales and Frequncies
### Examples 
### Conclusions
CWT with a Morlet analyzing wawvelet has connection wtih Fourier transform and for decomposing broadband wavelet data.
Applied to sesimic dat CWT can form basis of spectral decomposition or more exotic attributes asuch as Spice.
Wide range of seismic wavelet application have been reported over the last threee decades.
